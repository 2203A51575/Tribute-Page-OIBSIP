                <p>Kalam is absolutely a very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He had a keen interest in literature and wrote poems. He always faced media himself for his failures while let others address for the success. He died while delivering a lecture at the IIM.</p>
<p>	He always dreamt of flying right from his childhood, which drove to the invention of first Missiles of India named "PRITHVI AND AGNI". His struggles failed many times but they never stopped him anyway.</p>

<p>	Kalam always love to spend time motivating students and encouraging them to face challenges in life. But, He never married. He always stood for the people's well being and bright future. Hence, Kalam was best known as "PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT". </p>
